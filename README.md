# Legend Photos

A photo viewing application built with React Native for macOS.

## Development

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the package manager and [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting.

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   bun run mac
   ```

### Code Formatting and Linting

This project uses Biome for code formatting and linting. Biome is configured to format code on save in VSCode.

Available commands:

- Format code:
  ```bash
  bun run format
  ```

- Lint code:
  ```bash
  bun run lint
  ```

- Check and fix code:
  ```bash
  bun run check
  ```

### VSCode Integration

Biome is configured as the default formatter in VSCode. Install the [Biome VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) for the best experience.

The following settings are already configured in `.vscode/settings.json`:

- Format on save
- Organize imports on save
- Fix all auto-fixable issues on save

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
