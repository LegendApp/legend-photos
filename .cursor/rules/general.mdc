# General app structure

- Prefer named exports rather than default exports
- Prefer Legend State useObservable and use$ rather than useState

# Rules for you

- This is a React Native app, specifically a react-native-macOS app.
- If I ask to make a component, put it in its own file unless I specify otherwise
- This is a macOS app. Do not do anything Android, iOS, or web specific. It does not need fallbacks for if it's not a macos app.
- ONLY do what I ask you, nothing else. Do not do anything extra that I did not ask for.
- If I made changes after you, respect my changes and do not undo them.
- Use tailwind/nativewind classes rather than stylesheets.
- The command to run the project is `bun run mac`
